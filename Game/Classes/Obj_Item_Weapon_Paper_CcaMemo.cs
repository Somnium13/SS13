As you may know, SS13 has recently got its network up and running, which means that until we get this gate shipped off to the next colonization staging area, they'll be able to hop straight in here if its hooked up on our end.<br>Obviously, that's something I'd very much rather avoid. Our forensics and medical teams never did figure out what happened that last time... and I can't wrap my head around it myself. Why would a shuttle full of evacuees all snap and beat each other to death the moment they reached safety?<br>- D. Cereza";
