				<h3>Growing Humans</h3>

				Why would you want to grow humans? Well I'm expecting most readers to be in the slave trade, but a few might actually
				want to revive fallen comrades. Growing pod people is easy, but prone to disaster.

				<li>Find a dead person who is in need of cloning. </li>
				<li>Take a blood sample with a syringe. </li>
				<li>Inject a seed pack with the blood sample. </li>
				<li>Plant the seeds. </li>
				<li>Tend to the plants water and nutrition levels until it is time to harvest the cloned human.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
				It really is that easy! Good luck!
