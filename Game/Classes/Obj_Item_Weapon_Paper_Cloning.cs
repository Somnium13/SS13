	Congratulations, your station has purchased the H-87 industrial cloning device!<br>
	Using the H-87 is almost as simple as brain surgery! Simply insert the target humanoid into the scanning chamber and select the scan option to create a new profile!<br>
	<b>That's all there is to it!</b><br>
	<i>Notice, cloning system cannot scan inorganic life or small primates.  Scan may fail if subject has suffered extreme brain damage.</i><br>
	<p>Clone profiles may be viewed through the profiles menu. Scanning implants a complementary HEALTH MONITOR IMPLANT into the subject, which may be viewed from each profile.
	Profile Deletion has been restricted to [Station Head] level access.</p>
	<h4>Cloning from a profile</h4>
	Cloning is as simple as pressing the CLONE option at the bottom of the desired profile.<br>
	Per your company's EMPLOYEE PRIVACY RIGHTS agreement, the H-87 has been blocked from cloning crewmembers while they are still alive.<br>
	<br>
	<p>The provided CLONEPOD SYSTEM will produce the desired clone.  Standard clone maturation times (With SPEEDCLONE technology) are roughly 90 seconds.
	The cloning pod may be unlocked early with any [Medical Researcher] ID after initial maturation is complete.</p><br>
	<i>Please note that resulting clones may have a small DEVELOPMENTAL DEFECT as a result of genetic drift.</i><br>
	<h4>Profile Management</h4>
	<p>The H-87 (as well as your station's standard genetics machine) can accept STANDARD DATA DISKETTES.
	These diskettes are used to transfer genetic information between machines and profiles.
	A load/save dialog will become available in each profile if a disk is inserted.</p><br>
	<i>A good diskette is a great way to counter aforementioned genetic drift!</i><br>
