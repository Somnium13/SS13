			Nuclear Explosives 101:<br>
			Hello and thank you for choosing the Syndicate for your nuclear information needs.<br>
			Today's crash course will deal with the operation of a Fusion Class Nanotrasen made Nuclear Device.<br>
			First and foremost, DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING UNTIL THE BOMB IS IN PLACE.<br>
			Pressing any button on the compacted bomb will cause it to extend and bolt itself into place.<br>
			If this is done to unbolt it one must completely log in which at this time may not be possible.<br>
			To make the nuclear device functional:<br>
			<li>Place the nuclear device in the designated detonation zone.</li>
			<li>Extend and anchor the nuclear device from its interface.</li>
			<li>Insert the nuclear authorisation disk into slot.</li>
			<li>Type numeric authorisation code into the keypad. This should have been provided. Note: If you make a mistake press R to reset the device.
			<li>Press the E button to log onto the device.</li>
			You now have activated the device. To deactivate the buttons at anytime for example when you've already prepped the bomb for detonation	remove the auth disk OR press the R on the keypad.<br>
			Now the bomb CAN ONLY be detonated using the timer. Manual detonation is not an option.<br>
			Note: Nanotrasen is a pain in the neck.<br>
			Toggle off the SAFETY.<br>
			Note: You wouldn't believe how many Syndicate Operatives with doctorates have forgotten this step.<br>
			So use the - - and + + to set a det time between 5 seconds and 10 minutes.<br>
			Then press the timer toggle button to start the countdown.<br>
			Now remove the auth. disk so that the buttons deactivate.<br>
			Note: THE BOMB IS STILL SET AND WILL DETONATE<br>
			Now before you remove the disk if you need to move the bomb you can:<br>
			Toggle off the anchor, move it, and re-anchor.<br><br>
			Good luck. Remember the order:<br>
			<b>Disk, Code, Safety, Timer, Disk, RUN!</b><br>
			Intelligence Analysts believe that normal Nanotrasen procedure is for the Captain to secure the nuclear authorisation disk.<br>
			Good luck!
